# Analog_photoplethysmograph
An analog circuit for the photoplethysmograph and a power supply circuit have been developed. Taking into account the nature of the registered signal and its amplite and frequency characteristics, the engineering solution are  justified. The necessary calculations were carried out, all components were selected among the list of real models.
