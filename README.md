# Analog_photoplethysmograph
An analog circuit for the photoplethysmograph and a power supply circuit have been developed. Taking into account the nature of the registered signal and its amplite and frequency characteristics, the engineering solution are  justified. The necessary calculations were carried out, all components were selected among the list of real models.

Modeling in the Micro-Cap program  of the analog scheme for registering a photoplethysmogram has a number of limitations. The most significant is the need to replace optical phenomena with electrical influences, which makes inaccuracies in the resulting model. At the same time, thanks to such assumptions, it is possible to build the simplest analog circuit, which in theory is able to work as a separate medical device.
Since the photoplethysmograph is powered by a constant voltage of 5 V, a secondary power supply was developed and two implementations were proposed.
